### Step 4: Visualizing and Exploring Data

Once your favorites are set, the platform will display graphical analysis and trends for these locations directly on your dashboard.

* 
**Quick View:** You can see real-time or historical trends for PM2.5 or PM10 across your four selected areas.


* 
**Deep Dive:** To see more details or export data for a specific favorite, click the **"More"** link on any visualization chart. This will take you to the **Explore** page for deeper analysis.

### Tips for Effective Management

* 
**Updating Favorites:** You can change your four favorite locations at any time by repeating the "Customize" process.


* 
**Data Export:** If you need data for more than four locations, use the **Data Export** feature instead of Favorites to select a broader range of cities or countries.


* 
**Profile Settings:** You can also manage general preferences and your user profile on the **Settings** page.
