# About Vertex

Here you’ll find comprehensive information for managing your device lifecycle, configuring sensor networks, and ensuring seamless data flow to the AirQo ecosystem. We’ve designed this documentation to be a technical roadmap for hardware engineers, network managers, and partner organizations who need to onboard and maintain air quality monitoring equipment.

In keeping with AirQo’s commitment to transparency, Vertex is built on an **open-source foundation**. We provide the tools to integrate not only AirQo sensors but also **external hardware devices**, fostering a collaborative global network. Our codebase is open for contribution, and we invite developers to help us refine our device management protocols. You can explore the repository and contribute to our hardware-interfacing logic on GitHub: [https://github.com/airqo-platform/](https://github.com/airqo-platform/).

## Overview

Vertex serves as the central nervous system for the AirQo sensor network. It is a powerful, secure platform that allows organizations to deploy, monitor, and maintain air quality hardware with precision. By bridging the gap between physical sensors and digital insights, Vertex ensures that every data point collected is accurate, attributed, and actionable.

With Vertex, you manage the entire "life" of a device through a centralized workspace. Once you onboard a device—whether through a specialized Cohort ID for bulk deployment or via external integration—you gain full control over its metadata and operational status. As devices transmit telemetry, Vertex provides real-time health monitoring, allowing you to identify offline sensors, troubleshoot power issues, and manage maintenance logs. Furthermore, the platform empowers you to define **data privacy**, giving you the choice to contribute to the open-access map or maintain a private organizational network.
