# How to Add an External Device to Your Organization Account



## Overview

This guide explains how to add **external (non-AirQo) air quality devices** to the AirQo Vertex platform.

Use this process if:

* Your device is **not manufactured by AirQo**
* Your device manufacturer is **already listed** (e.g. AirBeam, AirGradient, Clarity, IQAir), or
* You want to register the device for **visibility and future integration** on AirQo Digital Platforms

Once added, your device will appear in Vertex for **management, tracking, and follow-up integration**.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* ✅ A Vertex account (log in at [vertex.airqo.net](https://vertex.airqo.net))
* ✅ Access to the **organization** where the device should be added
* ✅ Basic device details (name, serial number, manufacturer/network)


## Step 1: Log in to Vertex

1. Open your browser and go to: [https://vertex.airqo.net](https://vertex.airqo.net)
2. Log in using your AirQo account credentials.
3. Once logged in, you will be directed to the **Home** dashboard.


## Step 2: Select the Correct Organization

Devices are always added **within an organizational context**.

1. In the **top-right corner**, click the **Organization Picker** (this may show “AirQo” or another organization name).
2. Select the organization where you want to add the device.



## Step 3: Navigate to Import Device

2. The **Import Device** form will open.

Add extra details such as location, installation notes, or device purpose.



## Step 5: Submit the Device

Your device will now appear in **Assets/My Devices** under the selected organization.

Depending on the manufacturer and integration status:
