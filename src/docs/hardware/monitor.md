# AirQo Outdoor Air Monitor

## Know your Monitor

The AirQo Outdoor Air Monitor, also known as the Binos Outdoor Air monitor, is a low-cost air quality monitor that measures Particulate Matter PM2.5 and PM10, as well as ambient meteorological conditions such as humidity and atmospheric pressure. The monitor is locally built and uniquely designed to withstand environmental and physical conditions such as dust and extreme weather. Powered by either mains or solar, the monitor is optimised to work in settings characterised by unreliable power. It runs on a 2G GSM network configuration for IoT simards.

# Installation Guide

package tool kit provided as part of the full product. As part of the product
This section offers user-friendly guidance on monitor installation making use of the
packaging, you are provided with mounting equipment to support pole, wall, or face
mounting. Before installation, take note of the following pre-installation precautions.

## Precautions and Guides

- Install the monitor in a location with free air circulation.
- Avoid surface installation to protect the sensor from dust particles collecting on
  the surface. This affects the quality of the sensor readings.
- Avoid installing the monitor next to a pollution source such as an active waste
  incineration facility, active smoke sources, and sinks such as under trees and
  vegetation.
- Install the monitor vertically with sensor vents facing downwards.
- Mount the monitor at normal human breathing height (about 1.5-2m above the
  ground)

### Installation site guidelines

The process of finding an appropriate place to site and install the AirQo outdoor air
quality monitor is equally important. Indeed, the site where a sensor is placed can
impact the usefulness of the data. The table below briefly outlines some key logistical
considerations and recommendations to help with determining where to place the
sensor.

| Considerations                  | Breakdown                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Security                        | Security guards/ agents, CCTV Cameras                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Power Access                    | The site should either be a backup generator if the frequency of power outages are high Power and there should be a power socket. For solar installation: the site should assure; Sunshine reliability, Can solar panels be added without being shielded?                        |
| Communication reliability       | The site of installation choice should have high signal strength for easy communication with the AirQo platform. The installation site should be away from electrical interferences such as high power lines. Also, the siteshould allow; Network connectivity of both 2G and 5G |
| Access to the location          | The site of choice should be accessible with approval from local authorities and there should be a well constructed access road to the site.                                                                                                                                     |
| Distance from pollution sinks   | The installation site should be far away from; Trees, High walls with electric fences, Storey buildings                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Distance from pollution sources | The installation site should be far away from; Waste incinerators, Fire, Barbecue grill, Compost pit, Construction, Hyperlocal sources such as roads, chimney                                                                                                                    |

### Pre-Installation precautions

- Check whether you have all the tools and equipment
- Ensure there are no physical damages to the monitor.
- Take the monitor out of the packaging
- Set up the installation location such as a pole, wall, or mount on a flat surface
- Make sure the installation location can allow at least 270-degree airflow around the monitor inlet.
- Check the battery specification to understand whether the monitor is solar, or mains powered. Bigger battery specifications are normally reserved mainly for solar-powered monitors. It is worthy to note there are no limitations in having a solar-powered monitor powered by mains. This is a chosen design option by the AirQo team to

## Post-installation of the monitor

### Powering the monitor

- Powering the monitor
- Plug the provided power adapter into a socket and power cord into the monitor. If using a plug other than that provided by AirQo, make sure the plug specifications are 5V, 2A
- The monitor should beep twice to indicate power-up and battery charging
- Deeping on the number of beeps, the status of the monitor can be known as summarised in the table below

**Monitor alarms are summarised in the table below**

| Alarms               | Alarm Tones                    | Tone Details  | Duration   |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Power on             | One beep                       | High          | 0.5 second |
| Transmission failure | One beep                       | Low           | 0.5 second |
| Low battery          | Two beeps (repeated 8 seconds) | Low High      | 1 second   |
| Monitor restart      | Three beeps                    | High Low High | 1.5 second |

### Maintenance

To ensure safety of the system, maintenance should never be performed when the
monitor is powered or connected to the power adapter. The AirQo monitor contains
very sensitive sensors that damage when exposed to electro-static discharge and
extra precautions should be observed to protect sensors susceptible to electro-static
discharge.
