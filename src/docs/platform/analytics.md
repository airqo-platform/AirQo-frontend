# Analytics dashboard

On successful login you will be directed directly to the dashboard, this is the starting point for all activities with AirQo Analytics.

## Select Location

The platform provides a drop down menu which enables you to easily select a city or location of interest. This ensures that all your analysis on the page just focuses on that Location's Sites.

In the image above, the Fort Portal Location is selected. This means that all the content/data presented on the page will be fully focused on the Fort Portal Location. All the lower sections of the graph will provide data from the Fort Portal Sites only.

Image above indicates the various locations for selection. A user is free to select any location as long as they are configured to access it. At the moment, all users are able to access data for all locations as long as they have an AirQo dashboard account.

## Region status cards

Across the top of the dashboard, you will see the below cards.
<img src='_media/analytics_region_status_cards.png' alt='region_status_cards' />
These cards show the number of air quality monitors in the AirQo network and the quality of the air they are recording in real-time.

For example, the diagram above shows that 11 monitors are recording moderate air quality 25 monitors are recording air quality is unhealthy for sensitive groups (UHFSG) 57 monitors are recording unhealthy air quality while 5 monitors are recording very unhealthy air quality

## Mean daily PM

<img src='_media/analytics_mean_daily_pm.png' alt='mean_daily_pm' />
This chart shows the 24 hour mean (average) PM <small>2.5</small> levels for each device location for the last complete 28 days, usually from the day before the present day. This provides a medium term comparison of air quality in different locations. The colour of the bar represents the risk category at the location according to AQI. WHO Air Quality Guideline thresholds are shown by the horizontal line.

By clicking on the ellipsis (...), the 3 dots in the top right hand corner of the chart a drop down menu appears. The chart can be printed, exported as a pdf, jpeg, or png. jpeg and png are most suitable formats for including in reports or social media, either will do the job.

## Exceedances

<img src='_media/analytics_exceedances.png' alt='exceedances' />
Exceedances measure the number of days in the past 28 days for which daily pollutant levels have exceeded a minimum threshold for each location. The default view is EPA and the bar height shows the number of days that mean 24 hour levels have been above Moderate. The bars are further broken down so users can also see the number of days above the threshold for Unhealthy for sensitive groups, Unhealthy, Very unhealthy or Hazardous. In most cases values are above moderate for 28 the full 28 days.

To switch between WHO and AQI thresholds select the ellipsis / three dots (...) in the top right hand corner of the chart and select ‘Customize charts’. For WHO the chart shows the number of days in the past 28 days where the mean is above the WHO Air Quality Guideline of 25 μg/m3. In many cases NO2 levels are well below WHO and EPA levels so no values are visible.

Also, by clicking on the ellipsis (...) 3 dots in the top right hand corner of the chart, the charts can be printed, exported as a pdf, jpeg, or png. jpeg and png are most suitable for including in reports or social media.
