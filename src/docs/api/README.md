# Authentication

For each HTTP request, you will need to add the `Authorization` HEADER with it's respective token value. To get a token, you follow the [Login](api/users.md#login) guide.

```curl
curl --location --request GET 'api.airqo.net/api/v1/devices/sites?tenant=airqo' \
--header 'Authorization: JWT ey123abc'
```

The access token is unique to a each individual account. All keys have expiry periods which may be different for every user as specified by the AirQo administrator.
On expiry, a user can get for a new token by loggin in using their account credentials or a refresh token provided on first sign up.
