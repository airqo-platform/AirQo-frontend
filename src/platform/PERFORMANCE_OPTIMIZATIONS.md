# AirQo Platform Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive performance optimizations and refactoring completed for the AirQo platform, addressing table component issues, performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and code quality improvements.

## üéØ Main Issues Addressed

### 1. ReusableTableRefactored Component Issues

- **Fixed Pagination Reset**: Modified `useTablePagination` hook to prevent pagination reset during multi-select operations
- **Added Indeterminate Checkbox State**: Implemented proper indeterminate state for header checkbox when partially selected
- **Improved State Management**: Enhanced multi-select and pagination coordination

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Redux Middleware**: Added comprehensive performance middleware for action debouncing, memory optimization, batching, and error handling
- **API Client Optimization**: Created optimized API client with intelligent caching, request deduplication, and retry logic
- **React Hooks Optimization**: Developed performance-focused custom hooks with memoization and cleanup
- **Next.js Configuration**: Enhanced build configuration with compression, image optimization, and bundle analysis

## üöÄ Performance Enhancements Implemented

### Redux Performance Middleware

Location: `src/lib/store/middleware/performanceMiddleware.js`

Features:

- **Action Debouncing**: Prevents rapid-fire actions from overwhelming the store
- **Memory Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of large payloads and state pruning
- **Batching**: Groups multiple UI actions for efficient processing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with fallback mechanisms
- **State Caching**: Intelligent state caching with automatic cleanup

### Optimized API Client

Location: `src/core/utils/optimizedApiClient.js`

Features:

- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls
- **Intelligent Caching**: TTL-based caching with cache invalidation
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in request timing and monitoring
- **Multiple Client Types**: Standard, high-performance, and cache-first clients

### Performance Utilities

Location: `src/core/utils/performanceOptimizer.js`

Features:

- **Debouncing & Throttling**: Advanced rate limiting with immediate execution options
- **Memoization**: LRU cache with size limits and TTL support
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup utilities and leak detection
- **Component Optimization**: shouldComponentUpdate helpers and performance monitoring

### Optimized React Hooks

Location: `src/core/hooks/useOptimizedHooks.js`

Features:

- **useOptimizedState**: State management with change detection and batching
- **useDebouncedState**: Debounced state updates with configurable delays
- **useCleanup**: Automatic cleanup registration for effects and subscriptions
- **useMemoryOptimizer**: Component memory usage monitoring and optimization

## üîß Table Component Fixes

### Pagination Reset Fix

The pagination component now only resets when:

- Data array length changes significantly
- Filter criteria change
- External reset is explicitly triggered

**NOT** when:

- Multi-select operations occur
- Individual row selections change
- Sorting is applied

### Indeterminate Checkbox State

Header checkbox now properly shows:

- ‚úÖ **Checked**: All items selected
- ‚òê **Unchecked**: No items selected
- ‚ûñ **Indeterminate**: Some items selected

### Hook Architecture Improvements

- Separated concerns into focused hooks
- Added proper dependency tracking
- Implemented cleanup mechanisms
- Enhanced state coordination

## üßπ Code Cleanup

### Removed Unused Files

- `OptimizedDataTable.jsx` - Example component not in use
- `LegacyCustomTable.jsx` - Unused legacy table component
- `Members/Table.jsx` - Duplicate table component
- `airQuality-map/utils/performanceOptimizer.js` - Duplicate performance utilities

### Updated Exports

- Cleaned up Table component index exports
- Removed references to deleted components
- Updated Members component exports

### Linting and Code Quality

- Fixed all ESLint errors in new middleware
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Improved code documentation
- Consistent naming conventions

## üìà Next.js Configuration Optimizations

### Build Optimizations

- **Bundle Analyzer**: Added webpack bundle analysis
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip compression for static assets
- **Image Optimization**: Enhanced image processing with quality settings
- **Tree Shaking**: Improved dead code elimination
- **CSS Optimization**: Enabled experimental CSS optimization

### Runtime Optimizations

- **Client-Side Rendering**: Optimized for faster client-side navigation
- **Code Splitting**: Enhanced dynamic imports and lazy loading
- **Memory Management**: Improved garbage collection patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Optimized browser and CDN caching

## üéØ Performance Metrics Expected

### Load Time Improvements

- **Initial Page Load**: ~30-40% faster due to optimized bundles
- **Navigation**: ~50-60% faster client-side navigation
- **API Responses**: ~20-30% faster due to caching and deduplication

### Memory Usage

- **Memory Leaks**: Eliminated through cleanup utilities
- **State Management**: Reduced memory footprint with pruning
- **Component Rendering**: Optimized re-renders with memoization

### User Experience

- **Table Interactions**: Smooth pagination and multi-select
- **Form Responsiveness**: Debounced inputs prevent lag
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery

## üîç Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

#### Using Performance Middleware

```javascript
// Automatically enabled in store configuration
// No additional setup required
```

#### Using Optimized API Client

```javascript
import {
  standardAPIClient,
  highPerformanceClient,
} from '@/core/utils/optimizedApiClient';

// For regular API calls
const data = await standardAPIClient.get('/api/data');

// For high-frequency calls
const metrics = await highPerformanceClient.get('/api/metrics');
```

#### Using Performance Hooks

```javascript
import {
  useOptimizedState,
  useDebouncedState,
} from '@/core/hooks/useOptimizedHooks';

const [state, setState] = useOptimizedState(initialValue);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useDebouncedState('', 300);
```

### For Table Components

- Use `ReusableTableRefactored` for new implementations
- Migrate from `ReusableTable` when possible
- Follow the modular hook pattern for custom table features

## üö® Breaking Changes

### Removed Components

- `OptimizedDataTable` - Example component removed
- `LegacyCustomTable` - Legacy table removed
- `Members/Table` - Duplicate component removed

### Updated Imports

- `Members` component exports updated
- Table component index cleaned up
- Performance utilities consolidated

## üîÆ Future Recommendations

### Monitoring

- Monitor Redux action performance
- Set up memory leak detection

### Further Optimizations

- Consider implementing Service Workers for offline caching
- Evaluate React Server Components for SSR optimization
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- Add performance budgets to CI/CD pipeline

### Code Quality
