## Folder Structure

### src folder

The src folder is meant to separate application level code from the top-level configuration. The src folder is split into four main folders ie **core**, **lib**, **common** and **pages**.

    ├── common
    │   ├── components
    │   │   ├── Footer
    │   │   │   └── index.js
    │   │   │   └── Footer.module.scss
    │   │   ├── SideBar
    │   │   │   └── index.js
    │   │   │   └── SideBar.module.scss
    │   │   │   └── components
    │   │   │   │   └── Profile
    │   │   │   │   │   └── index.js
    │   │   │   │   │   └── Profile.module.scss
    │   ├── styles
    │   │   ├── global.scss
    ├── pages
    │   ├── app.js
    │   ├── Dashboard.js
    ├── lib
    ├── core

**Core**: This is where we place everything unrelated to the domain like API functions, DB functions including firebase/firestore connections, Authentication utilities, provider to send emails.

The nature of this folder is that you cannot import stuff from the lib, pages and components folders.

**Lib**: This is where we place utilities that will be mostly used by our components and partly in the pages. Utilities like;

- Custom hooks
- Prop functions eg getInitialProps, getServerSideProps
- Redux

This folder is also not supposed to import stuff from the pages and components folders.

**Common**: This is where we place the reusable UI components and the global css styles ie components and styles.
Under components, we can for example a SideBar component. What if our SideBar component had components within it that aren’t used elsewhere in the application eg Profile? We create a components folder within the SideBar component folder and add those components with their styles. The styles folder is where we place the global css styles.

### public folder

The public folder is meant for adding application public assets like images, gifs, and video clips

### cypress folder

This is an auto-generated folder structure for writing in Cypress tests [according to this documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests).

### Top-level configuration

Below are the configuration files at the project top level

- [next.config.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction)
