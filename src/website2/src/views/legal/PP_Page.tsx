            This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the

            committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and ensuring
            responsible use of the information that we collect.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build a range of products and services to help individuals and
            decision makers access timely air quality information and help drive
            action to mitigate and reduce air pollution in cities and other
            spaces. Our products and services include, without limitation, air
            quality sensing technologies, digital air quality platforms and
            tools, web and mobile apps for accessing, understanding and
            interpreting air quality.

            When you use our services, we may collect information to help us
            improve and customize our products to better meet the needs of our
            users. We may collect this information explicitly or automatically
            using available third-party tools. AirQo is committed to ensuring
            the responsible use of the information that we collect.
          </p>

            This policy was developed to help you understand the information we
            collect and the measures we put in place to ensure privacy.

            When you sign up to use our air quality digital platforms including
            mobile and website apps and platform analytics, we ask you to
            provide certain information such as name, phone number, email
            address and password. The information collected is used to set up
            and manage the user&apos;s account on our digital platforms. We use
            contact information such as phone and email to communicate with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you agree to be a host of air quality monitoring devices, we
            may collect personal information such as name and phone number.
            Additionally, we may also collect metadata including photosâ€™
            demographic and description of the site as well as geolocation
            information. We use this information to support the maintenance and
            management of the air quality network. Our air quality monitoring
            devices collect location information which helps us to associate air
            quality measurements with specific locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also collect data through voluntary surveys to understand
            user experiences and inform improvements. We may commission studies
            and surveys to collect data to help us understand users&apos;
            perceptions and behavior on air quality management. We use this
            information to help link air quality information to action and
            policies to help improve air quality. We also use this data to
            measure our impact. We aggregate the information from surveys to
            remove any personal identifying data.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use our digital tools including website, web and
            mobile-based apps, we may collect information on your interaction
            with our services. We may use Third party tools such as Google
            Analytics, iOS and Android analytics. This information helps us to
            understand usage patterns and inform refinements and improvements of
            our products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our products and services may collect technical logs to support the
            troubleshooting of errors or bugs in our products. For example,
            understanding the devices where our app crashes can help us fix bugs
            and improve performance resulting in a better user experience.
