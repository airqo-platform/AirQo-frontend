                  We build a range of products and services to help individuals and decision makers
                  access timely air quality information and help drive action to mitigate and reduce
                  air pollution in cities and other spaces. Our products and services include,
                  without limitation, air quality sensing technologies, digital air quality
                  platforms and tools, web and mobile apps for accessing, understanding and

                  When you use our services, we may collect information to help us improve and
                  customize our products to better meet the needs of our users. We may collect this

                  such as name, phone number, email address and password. The information collected
                  is used to set up and manage the user's account on our digital platforms. We use

                  collect metadata including photos’ demographic and description of the site as well
                  as geolocation information. We use this information to support the maintenance and
                  management of the air quality network. Our air quality monitoring devices collect
                  location information which helps us to associate air quality measurements with
                  specific locations.

                  and inform improvements. We may commission studies and surveys to collect data to
                  help us understand users' perceptions and behavior on air quality management. We
                  use this information to help link air quality information to action and policies
                  to help improve air quality. We also use this data to measure our impact. We
                  aggregate the information from surveys to remove any personal identifying data.
