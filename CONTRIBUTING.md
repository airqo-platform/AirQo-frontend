- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with any of our products, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/airqo-platform/AirQo-frontend/issues) to establish if the problem has already been reported. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/airqo-platform/AirQo-frontend/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/airqo-platform/AirQo-frontend/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository).

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes, with a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) once you are happy with them.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to test and self-review them to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, AirQo team members will review your proposal.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can apply suggested changes and/or make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada:
The AirQo team thanks you :sparkles:.
